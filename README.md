<summary><b><font size="+1">1. What is the difference between private, internal, public, and external functions?</font></b></summary>

`private` can only be used within the current contract, `internal` can also be used within derived contracts, `public` functions can be used inside and outside the current contract (by users and the contract itself), `external` functions can only be used by users.

<summary><b><font size="+1">2. Approximately, how large can a smart contract be?</font></b></summary>

About 24,000 bytes and (4.7 million gas). According to EIP-170: In short, the point of this EIP is to minimize the overloading of nodes (especially light nodes) and to prevent possible DOS attacks.

<summary><b><font size="+1">3. What is the difference between create and create2?</font></b></summary>

`CREATE` is used in the default scenario when you deploy a smart contract via `new` for example. `CREATE2` is also used to deploy smart contracts, but it has a special parameter - `salt`, which allows you to predetermine the future address of the contract.

<summary><b><font size="+1">4. What major change with arithmetic happened with Solidity 0.8.0?</font></b></summary>

More secure arithmetic operations without explicitly using the `SafeMath` library (preventing underflows and overflows).

<summary><b><font size="+1">5. What special CALL is required for proxies to work?</font></b></summary>

`DELEGATECALL` because it allows you to pass all the call context to the proxy contract and also to keep the storage states.

<summary><b><font size="+1">6. Prior to EIP-1559, how do you calculate the dollar cost of an Ethereum transaction?</font></b></summary>

It used a simple gas price auction system and this system had some downsides such as: highly volatile gas price and delays for users.

<summary><b><font size="+1">7. What are the challenges of creating a random number on the blockchain?</font></b></summary>

Because blockchain is a fully open system it means you can simulate and predict almost everything on it and all attempts to create true RNG were failed so for RNG on blockchain builders usually use some oracles like - https://docs.chain.link/vrf.

<summary><b><font size="+1">8. What is the difference between a Dutch Auction and an English Auction?</font></b></summary>

In an English auction, the auctioneer sets a base price and bidders compete to see who can offer a higher price. In a Dutch auction, it's the other way round - the auctioneer sets a high price and goes lower and lower until someone agrees to accept the price.

<summary><b><font size="+1">9. What is the difference between transfer and transferFrom in ERC20?</font></b></summary>

`transfer` only transfers the amount of tokens from `msg.sender`. `transferFrom` uses an allowance system, so for example if you want the contract to use your ERC20 token you can set an allowance for it to use your tokens so it can send the tokens on your behalf: `transferFrom(you, someone, amount)`.

<summary><b><font size="+1">10. Which is better to use for an address allowlist: a mapping or an array? Why?</font></b></summary>

It's better to use a mapping, because it's cheaper to check an allowance, and the array can lead to a DOS attack if the number of users is too large.

<summary><b><font size="+1">11. Why shouldnâ€™t tx.origin be used for authentication?</font></b></summary>

This is because if the contract the user is calling is malicious - the malicious contract can act on behalf of the initial caller, but this will not happen if you use `msg.sender` instead, because in this situation the caller would be the malicious contract itself, not the user.

<summary><b><font size="+1">15. What is the difference between assert and require?</font></b></summary>

`assert` is usually used to check for internal errors (e.g. invariants), since this call is also used natively in the Solidity compiler itself, and also asserting panic errors should not happen in a well-tested contract, otherwise you have a bug in it. The `require` keyword is usually used to check for errors in user input/actions.

<summary><b><font size="+1">17. What is the check-effects pattern?</font></b></summary>

Check-Effects (and Interactions) is a structural pattern of code that allows you to avoid some cases of `reentrancy`, because first you do all the necessary checks, then you change a local state, and only then you interact with other contracts, otherwise you could be open to `reentrancy` attacks.

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">19. What is the difference between fallback and receive?</font></b></summary>

The `receive` function is only triggered when an ETH event is received (with empty calldata), but the `fallback` function is triggered at any time if you call some data that didn't exist in the contract's ABI. And to make these functions work, you need to specify them explicitly.

_Reference_: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/contracts.html#receive-ether-function

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">20. What is reentrancy?</font></b></summary>

Reentrancy is a type of attack where the attacker re-enters your function and performs repetitive actions without any constraints (this action could be updating the state of the contract/draining tokens/creating votes and so on). Reentrancy is usually performed in functions where external interactions occur before the local state changes.

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">22. What prevents infinite loops from running forever?</font></b></summary>

There's a maximum cap for executing a transaction, and because the transaction requires an infinite amount of gas to execute - it can't be executed in the Ethereum ecosystem because the block has a cap of 30M gas per block.

<summary><b><font size="+1">23. What is the difference between tx.origin and msg.sender?</font></b></summary>

`tx.origin` - initial user address that started execution of the transaction, `msg.sender` address that called current function, it can be another contract for example.

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">24. How do you send Ether to a contract that does not have payable functions, or a receive or fallback?</font></b></summary>

You can do this using the `selfdestruct` operation, because when the contract is destroyed all its value would be sent to the specified address.

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">26. What is the difference between transferFrom and safeTransferFrom in ERC721?</font></b></summary>

`safeTransferFrom` checks if the receiver is a contract and if it is a contract - it requires it to implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface, so you won't send your NFT to the contract without any way of getting it back, just `transferFrom` doesn't do this check.

<summary><b><font size="+1">27. How can an ERC1155 token be made into a non-fungible token?</font></b></summary>

It's possible to set the maximum amount of each token to 1, so that each token has only 1 copy of itself. This can be done by setting the number of token copies when minting the token.

<details open>
<summary><b><font size="+1">28. What is access control and why is it important?</font></b></summary>

Access control is a restriction mechanism that ensures that only users with certain roles/responsibilities can call some of the functions. For example, you don't want your users to have access to the `mint' function, because they can just mint a lot of tokens for themselves, defeating the purpose of NFT collection.

Fixed interest rate - remains the same for the whole period (of loan for example), Variable interest fixed rate - can change during the period. Variable rates involve more risks, but they can save you more money or you will lose more money if some of the conditions would change (like economic ones or some internal policies).

<summary><b><font size="+1">1. What is the difference between transfer and send? Why should they not be used?</font></b></summary>

`transfer` throws an error on failure, `send` returns false on failure. It's better to use `call` because `transfer` and `send` have hardcoded 2300 gas and if some of the EVM opcodes start using more gas - all transfers and calls might not work anymore.

<summary><b><font size="+1">3. What is a storage collision in a proxy contract?</font></b></summary>

Storage collision is a mechanism of proxy contracts when storage states from the source contract collide with the new proxy contract and the memory states are passed on to the new contract. Small example: we have a contract with the first variable uint256 a = 3; if we are going to update the proxy and the first state variable of the proxy is also uint256 - then this variable will also store the number "3", and that's why it's important not to change the order of states when dealing with proxy updates.

<summary><b><font size="+1">7. What is frontrunning?</font></b></summary>

Frontrunning is a method of placing your transaction ahead of some targeted transaction, often the purpose of frontrunning is to make a profit. For example: Bot sees that some whale is buying a large amount of some token (and it will defintely drive the price up because there would be less liquidity of that token in some pool or market), so it sends its own buy transaction with higher gas because it wants to buy tokens for lower price. Then the bot can sell those tokens at a higher price after the whale's buy transaction, because the price has gone up. This is called a Sanwich attack.

<summary><b><font size="+1">8. What is a commit-reveal scheme and when would you use it?</font></b></summary>

Commit-reveal scheme is a technique used to protect against frontrunning, where you upload some sensitive value to the smart contract in an encrypted format, and then reveal it using some kind of hash that verifies that you actually put that value in and not some other value. Also, commit-reveal schemes often have logic to close commits for some time, so that frontrunners cannot commit any useful data in the last few seconds. One of the use-cases might be an implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game.

<summary><b><font size="+1">9. Under what circumstances could abi.encodePacked create a vulnerability?</font></b></summary>

If the values that you are trying to encode are dynamic arrays - this could affect the end result, for example `abi.encodePacked([a,b], [c,d])` would have the same hash as a `abi.encodePacked([a,b,c], [d])`.

<summary><b><font size="+1">12. How does an AMM price assets?</font></b></summary>

Based on the `x*y=k` formula, the price is basically based on the reserves of the tokens, if you had a pool of 30k USDT and 10 ETH this means that the correlation is 30,000/10 = 3000 USDT per ETH, if the reserve of USDT or ETH would change and it won't be equal to the actual price - arbitrage bots will use this opportunity to regulate the price (because if your asset costs more or less than a market price - bots can abuse it in order to get profit).

<summary><b><font size="+1">13. What is a function selector clash in a proxy and how does it happen?</font></b></summary>

Function clashing is an exploit that allows some functions to be executed through the proxy that the user didn't intend to execute, by creating a function with the same signature. For example, we have a malicious contract owner (who can upgrade the proxy), if he creates a function on the proxy with the exact signature that the user will use later - it will be executed instead of the function that the user wanted to execute.

<summary><b><font size="+1">14. What is the effect on gas of making a function payable?</font></b></summary>

Actually, all functions are payable by default in EVM, so not specifying the `payable` keyword will add opcodes to reverse execution if the `msg.value` is greater than zero. So the payable function is cheaper than the non-payable one.

<summary><b><font size="+1">15. What is a signature replay attack?</font></b></summary>

The signature replay attack is an attack that allows some functionality to be performed multiple times using a signature, even if it was designed to be performed once, or allows someone else to perform functionality using the other person's signature. It can be solved by using the `msg.sender` check and also adding `nonce` logic to the code so that the signature can't be used more than once.

<summary><b><font size="+1">16. What is gas griefing?</font></b></summary>

Gas griefing is an attack technique that allows a malicious user to prevent users from executing transactions when there's no external call success check. It can be done by providing just enough gas to execute a top-level transaction, and then censoring the data so that the original user can't execute it later.

<summary><b><font size="+1">22. Why shouldnâ€™t upgradeable contracts use the constructor?</font></b></summary>

Because the constructor is called only once, and this code is not part of the runtime bytecode of a deployed smart contract. So this context won't be passed to the proxy contract. So it's better to use an `initializer` method instead.

<summary><b><font size="+1">24. If a contract delegatecalls an empty address or an implementation that was previously self-destructed, what happens? What if it is a regular call instead of a delegatecall?</font></b></summary>

It will return true, because even though the storage is empty for that address, the EVM still recognizes the existence of this address and decides that the `call`/`delegatecall` was successful.

The killer feature of the ERC777 standard is the receive hook, which allows you to react to the incoming tokens, similar to onERC721Received for NFT. This can be handy, but it also opens up the possibility of reentrancy attacks by giving the attacker another way to re-enter the contract.

<summary><b><font size="+1">29. How does safeMint differ from mint in the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation?</font></b></summary>

`safeMint` checks 2 things: 1. the existence of `tokenId` (it won't mint the same token twice), 2. if `to` is a contract - it should implement the `onERC721Received` function. `mint` function doesn't check these conditions.

<summary><b><font size="+1">31. What is a sandwich attack?</font></b></summary>

Inserting a transaction before and after a targeted transaction in order to make a profit. Example: Bot sees that some whale is buying a large amount of some token (and it will defintely drive the price up because there would be less liquidity of that token in some pool or market), so it sends its own buy transaction with higher gas because it wants to buy tokens for lower price. Then the bot can sell those tokens at a higher price after the whale's buy transaction, because the price has gone up. This is called a Sanwich attack.

ERC721A is a new implementation of ERC721 pattern but with some upsides and downsides:
Upsides:

- mints are much cheaper

Downsides:

- transfers are more expensive

Mint optimization technique: it doesn't update all default mappings with info about token owner on each mint, it does it once during batch mint. Because of this, you don't have information about the tokenId owner, so you have to iterate the array first to find the owner of the token.

One of the main reasons is the fact that fixed-point arithmetic is not very predictable and can lead to forks on different nodes, which is why EVM itself doesn't want to deal with it, but Solidity has started to implement floating-point numbers using the same technique used in the ERC20 tokens - https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#fixed-point-numbers.

<summary><b><font size="+1">41. What is TWAP?</font></b></summary>

TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) - is a pricing algorithm used to calculate the price of an asset for a period of time. It can be done by taking different prices at equally distant points in time and then dividing the sum of them by the length of the points:

For example, imagine we wanted to calculate the TWAP of an asset over one minute using 15-second price point intervals. If the prices were $100 at zero seconds, $102 at 15 seconds, $101 at 30 seconds, $98 at 45 seconds, and $103 at 60 seconds, then to calculate the TWAP we would sum all price points (100, 102, 101, 99, 103) and then divide them by the number of timepoints (five). In this example, the TWAP is $101.

<summary><b><font size="+1">7. What is an inflation attack in ERC4626?</font></b></summary>

ERC4626 is the vault where users can deposit their tokens and get share tokens in return. When you deposit tokens via standard function - you will get some amount of share tokens, but if you will just send them to the contract - you will get nothing. So the attack is simple:

1. attacker sees a deposit from another user to the empty pool
2. attacker deposits 1 token and get in return 1 share
3. attacker deposits amount of token that the user is trying to deposit (10k for example)
4. user transaction executed and he deposits 10k tokens.
5. we have a formula: `shares_received = assets_deposited * totalSupply() / totalAssets();`. this means:

`shares_received = 10,000 * 1 / 10,001 => sharesToReceive = 0.99990000999` and because solidity doesn't support fixed point numbers - user won't receive any shares in the end.
